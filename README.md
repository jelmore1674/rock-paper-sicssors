# Rock Paper Scissors Game

---

I am working on a Javascript project for "The Odin Project". This project will
be creating the simple childhood game of _Rock, Paper, Scissors_.

---

## Updates

Here I will track my progress as I build the program. I will keep this as a log
to help me keep track of what I am doing. When I make big changes throughout the
project.

## _Update 1_

I have the game working, however, I am struggling with getting the results to
actually count. Not sure where to look this up at.
